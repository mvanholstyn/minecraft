2013-07-20 00:20:32 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> ok
2013-07-20 00:21:02 [INFO] <Bumtop> apparently sugar cane needs 2, but i don't know if thats needed for stuff like melons
2013-07-20 00:21:20 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> did we do 2 under those?
2013-07-20 00:21:46 [INFO] <Bumtop> most of it, there are a few patches that didn't but i dont have any more to plant right now
2013-07-20 00:22:42 [INFO] <Bumtop> might as well go a little deeper. there's iron over here.
2013-07-20 00:29:48 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> BAM
2013-07-20 00:30:07 [INFO] <Bumtop> when you gather sugar cane, don't cut it all the way down
2013-07-20 00:30:12 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> ok
2013-07-20 00:30:17 [INFO] <Bumtop> always leave a bit in the ground
2013-07-20 00:30:42 [INFO] <Bumtop> good call!
2013-07-20 00:32:20 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> what do you plant?
2013-07-20 00:32:29 [INFO] <Bumtop> sugar cane
2013-07-20 00:33:03 [INFO] <Bumtop> got more dirt?
2013-07-20 00:33:07 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> yup
2013-07-20 00:34:26 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> what do you need it for?
2013-07-20 00:34:32 [INFO] <Bumtop> sugar
2013-07-20 00:34:52 [INFO] <Bumtop> gonna be honest, we don't really need sugar for anything important
2013-07-20 00:34:59 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> lol
2013-07-20 00:35:03 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> what is it used for?
2013-07-20 00:35:07 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> paper i know
2013-07-20 00:35:12 [INFO] <Bumtop> to make paper and food
2013-07-20 00:36:04 [INFO] <Bumtop> its like chickens kinda
2013-07-20 00:36:28 [INFO] <Bumtop> in that this is probably overkill for what we really need
2013-07-20 00:36:33 [INFO] <Bumtop> but it is impressive
2013-07-20 00:36:46 [INFO] <Bumtop> especially for how fast it seems to be growing already
2013-07-20 00:39:04 [INFO] <Bumtop> ooooohhhh
2013-07-20 00:39:18 [INFO] <Bumtop> the patches it can't grow in are cause of the water requirements
2013-07-20 00:39:49 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> ah
2013-07-20 00:40:06 [INFO] <Bumtop> needs to share at least one side with a water block
2013-07-20 00:40:29 [INFO] <Bumtop> oh well, the outer rows will just have some patches for now
2013-07-20 00:43:24 [INFO] <Bumtop> think i'm going to convert the little sugar cane patch into a melon patch
2013-07-20 00:56:53 [INFO] <Bumtop> so much sugar!!!!
2013-07-20 00:58:48 [INFO] <Bumtop> haha i was just thinking about that
2013-07-20 01:04:38 [INFO] <Bumtop> can we make bricks?
2013-07-20 01:04:50 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> yes, with clay
2013-07-20 01:05:02 [INFO] <Bumtop> where in the world did you find clay?
2013-07-20 01:05:09 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> in the water

2013-07-20 02:31:28 [INFO] <Bumtop> sure
2013-07-20 02:31:36 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> this version (requires widening the tower
2013-07-20 02:31:43 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> runs on the outside of the stairs
2013-07-20 02:32:01 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> this version
2013-07-20 02:32:03 [INFO] <Bumtop> ah, i see
2013-07-20 02:32:12 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> runs up the center

2013-07-20 02:33:03 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> yes
2013-07-20 02:33:33 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> this version takes less track too
2013-07-20 02:33:37 [INFO] <Bumtop> right
2013-07-20 02:33:46 [INFO] <Bumtop> but it looks kinda ugo
2013-07-20 02:34:47 [INFO] <Bumtop> i would rather do the wide track, but it's really up to you
2013-07-20 02:35:02 [INFO] <Bumtop> you built most of the tower
2013-07-20 02:35:48 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> ok, i gotta do a little more experimenting tomorrow

2013-08-11 20:55:36 [INFO] <Bumtop> hi!
2013-08-11 20:55:41 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> hey
2013-08-11 20:55:46 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> more space@
2013-08-11 20:55:50 [INFO] <Bumtop> yay!
2013-08-11 20:55:57 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> and over here
2013-08-11 20:56:02 [INFO] <Bumtop> i've actually been working in the quarry lately
2013-08-11 20:56:16 [INFO] <Bumtop> oh sweet
2013-08-11 20:56:19 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> what have yo been doing there?
2013-08-11 20:56:33 [INFO] <Bumtop> it's actually a better place for a mob farm
2013-08-11 20:56:51 [INFO] <Bumtop> i had a prototype next to the tower a few days ago
2013-08-11 20:57:04 [INFO] <Bumtop> it worked, but didn't really produce as much as i had hoped
2013-08-11 20:57:27 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> checking out the quarry
2013-08-11 20:58:39 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> so what is the goal here?
2013-08-11 20:58:51 [INFO] <Bumtop> i'm just flattening the sides
2013-08-11 20:59:10 [INFO] <Bumtop> mobs spawn within 144 blocks of a player where the light level is less than 7
2013-08-11 20:59:10 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> taking out this whole chunk we are standing on all the way down?
2013-08-11 20:59:16 [INFO] <Bumtop> yup
2013-08-11 21:02:02 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> so once we get this cleared, then what?
2013-08-11 21:02:18 [INFO] <Bumtop> i build the mob farm up 25 blocks from the top
2013-08-11 21:02:32 [INFO] <Bumtop> cause a mob won't spawn within 24 blocks of a player
2013-08-11 21:03:28 [INFO] <Bumtop> the idea is that once we're done leveling this out, i'll light up the bottom
2013-08-11 21:03:38 [INFO] <Bumtop> that way, the mobs will only spawn up in the farm
2013-08-11 21:04:10 [INFO] <Bumtop> we might want head back now
2013-08-11 21:04:40 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> where is out?
2013-08-11 21:04:41 [INFO] <Bumtop> did you fall in?
2013-08-11 21:06:48 [INFO] <Bumtop> did you see all the chickens in the ovens?
2013-08-11 21:07:11 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> yeah
2013-08-11 21:07:18 [INFO] <Bumtop> i made like 200 chickens with eggs, and killed them all
2013-08-11 21:07:27 [INFO] <Bumtop> and we still have a chest full of eggs
2013-08-11 21:07:49 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> need pickaxes?
2013-08-11 21:07:56 [INFO] <Bumtop> yes
2013-08-11 21:08:06 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> more?
2013-08-11 21:08:15 [INFO] <Bumtop> nah, that should be enough for the next run
2013-08-11 21:09:01 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> ok, slee time!
2013-08-11 21:09:29 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> i got beds so we can sleep at the quarry

2013-08-11 21:24:57 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> how far down do we need to go?
2013-08-11 21:25:13 [INFO] <Bumtop> i still need to level off the bottom
2013-08-11 21:25:21 [INFO] <Bumtop> i didn't really measure the distance down
2013-08-11 21:25:34 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> does it need to be a particular height?
2013-08-11 21:25:52 [INFO] <Bumtop> technically 144

2013-08-11 23:41:06 [INFO] <Bumtop> out
2013-08-11 23:41:37 [INFO] Bumtop was shot by Skeleton
2013-08-11 23:41:41 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> oh no!
2013-08-11 23:42:30 [INFO] <Bumtop> too many zombies
2013-08-11 23:42:33 [INFO] <Bumtop> and skeletons
2013-08-11 23:42:46 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> sleepy time
2013-08-11 23:44:17 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> this a good place?
2013-08-11 23:44:26 [INFO] <Bumtop> oh, a ladder up the thing
2013-08-11 23:44:33 [INFO] <Bumtop> i don't think we really need one
2013-08-11 23:44:43 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> we don't go up there?
2013-08-11 23:44:46 [INFO] <Bumtop> nope
2013-08-11 23:44:48 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> i dont understand this thing
2013-08-11 23:45:06 [INFO] <Bumtop> there are water channels that push the mobs to the center
2013-08-11 23:45:13 [INFO] <Bumtop> and they fall to their death
2013-08-11 23:45:14 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> up there?
2013-08-11 23:45:17 [INFO] <Bumtop> yup
2013-08-11 23:45:25 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> what is the hole for?
2013-08-11 23:45:26 [INFO] <Bumtop> you just saw two creepers do it
2013-08-11 23:45:31 [INFO] <Bumtop> for them to fall out of
2013-08-11 23:45:38 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> the big hole we dug
2013-08-11 23:45:46 [INFO] <Bumtop> oooohhhh
2013-08-11 23:46:02 [INFO] <Bumtop> to prevent mobs from spawning elsewhere
2013-08-11 23:46:27 [INFO] <Bumtop> basically, we made it so that the only place they can spawn is up in the farm
2013-08-11 23:46:47 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> cant they spawn on the grass here?
2013-08-11 23:46:48 [INFO] <Bumtop> cause they need to spawn somewhere dark and farther than 24 blocks from us
2013-08-11 23:46:57 [INFO] <Bumtop> not in the daytime :)
2013-08-11 23:47:06 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> gotcha
2013-08-11 23:47:17 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> so what does this get us?
2013-08-11 23:47:27 [INFO] <Bumtop> i just got 4 gunpowders
2013-08-11 23:47:37 [INFO] <Bumtop> almost time for more TNT :D
2013-08-11 23:47:42 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> haha
2013-08-11 23:47:48 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> all that work for more tnt :)
2013-08-11 23:47:52 [INFO] <Bumtop> skeletons will give us arrows and bones
2013-08-11 23:48:04 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> thats an impressive structure
2013-08-11 23:48:07 [INFO] <Bumtop> would you rather go hunting creepers?
2013-08-11 23:48:10 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> no
2013-08-11 23:48:35 [INFO] <Bumtop> speaking of, there's one stuck in the quarry
2013-08-11 23:49:16 [INFO] <Bumtop> that actually helped a little
2013-08-11 23:49:41 [INFO] <Bumtop> yeah, it's not a very fast-working farm
2013-08-11 23:49:57 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> how do we make it faster?
2013-08-11 23:49:58 [INFO] <Bumtop> i could eventually rig it with more water and some pistons
2013-08-11 23:50:02 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> make it bigger?
2013-08-11 23:50:17 [INFO] <Bumtop> the only way to be sure is to probably make the quarry bigger
2013-08-11 23:50:46 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> gotcha
2013-08-11 23:50:54 [INFO] <Bumtop> it should be okay for now
2013-08-11 23:51:10 [INFO] <Bumtop> the prototype i did produced about 35 TNT after a couple days
2013-08-11 23:51:50 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> not bad
2013-08-11 23:52:13 [INFO] <Bumtop> what kills me is that i have no idea how many are in there right now
2013-08-11 23:52:25 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> is the top closed?
2013-08-11 23:53:06 [INFO] <Bumtop> yes
2013-08-11 23:53:13 [INFO] <Bumtop> it's completely dark in there
2013-08-11 23:53:29 [INFO] <Bumtop> some might be spawning in the hidden caves attached to the quarry
2013-08-11 23:55:19 [INFO] <Bumtop> we've got company
2013-08-11 23:55:51 [INFO] <Bumtop> umm i have no sword now

2013-08-12 00:07:26 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> can we make these paths wider?
2013-08-12 00:07:31 [INFO] <Bumtop> sure

2013-08-25 11:53:59 [INFO] <samuelmikel> Have you been at this all night? ;)
2013-08-25 11:54:15 [INFO] <Bumtop> Nope, just got back on about an hour ago
2013-08-25 11:54:50 [INFO] <samuelmikel> What is your name IRL?
2013-08-25 11:54:56 [INFO] <Bumtop> Mitch
2013-08-25 11:55:18 [INFO] <samuelmikel> Gotcha - good to meet you.
2013-08-25 11:55:30 [INFO] <Bumtop> Good to meet you too
2013-08-25 11:58:14 [INFO] <samuelmikel> Any idea why I can't put a bed down?
2013-08-25 11:58:28 [INFO] <Bumtop> Where are you trying to put it?
2013-08-25 11:58:42 [INFO] <samuelmikel> It wont let me place it up here for some reason. I'm trying to put it with the others.
2013-08-25 11:58:51 [INFO] <Bumtop> That's weird
2013-08-25 11:59:03 [INFO] <Bumtop> Right or left-clicking?
2013-08-25 11:59:13 [INFO] <samuelmikel> Both
2013-08-25 11:59:27 [INFO] <samuelmikel> Here see if it works for you
2013-08-25 12:00:15 [INFO] <Bumtop> Yeah, it's not getting placed for some reason
2013-08-25 12:00:18 [INFO] <samuelmikel> Looks like you're having trouble too - weird.
2013-08-25 12:00:33 [INFO] <Bumtop> It goes down fine on the brick
2013-08-25 12:00:35 [INFO] <samuelmikel> Something to do with glass?
2013-08-25 12:01:05 [INFO] <Bumtop> Could be, but if the others are on glass, it should be okay to go on it
2013-08-25 12:01:24 [INFO] <Bumtop> You can try dirt
2013-08-25 12:01:47 [INFO] <Bumtop> Very weird
2013-08-25 12:01:51 [INFO] <Bumtop> Might be a glitch
2013-08-25 12:02:01 [INFO] <samuelmikel> Maybe I can just put glass under it now.
2013-08-25 12:02:09 [INFO] <Bumtop> It's worth a try
2013-08-25 12:02:35 [INFO] <Bumtop> That's probably what Mark did
2013-08-25 12:02:42 [INFO] <Bumtop> Cause this all used to be cobblestone
2013-08-25 12:04:07 [INFO] <Bumtop> Stupid creepers
2013-08-25 12:04:12 [INFO] <samuelmikel> Yep
2013-08-25 12:04:17 [INFO] <samuelmikel> Came out of nowhere
2013-08-25 12:04:27 [INFO] <Bumtop> I blame Mark's water wall over there
2013-08-25 12:04:34 [INFO] <Bumtop> They come right through it
2013-08-25 12:07:44 [INFO] <Bumtop> Should be all good now

2013-09-01 22:28:09 [INFO] <Bumtop> pressure plates will go in front of the repeaters
2013-09-01 22:28:28 [INFO] <Bumtop> which will cause the wool blocks to push an enderman down a level
2013-09-01 22:28:36 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> why wool?

2013-09-01 22:44:01 [INFO] <Bumtop> for triggering the pistons
2013-09-01 22:44:12 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> cant you just use redstone?
2013-09-01 22:44:34 [INFO] <Bumtop> don't know, the guy's example used repeaters
2013-09-01 22:45:21 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> can you throw me some pressure plates?

2013-09-01 22:46:19 [INFO] <Bumtop> when you put 3 in a row, they connect to each other instead of the pistons

2013-09-06 20:54:58 [INFO] <Bumtop> we'll have to send you a link to the wiki
2013-09-06 20:55:03 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> yeah
2013-09-06 20:55:06 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> now what
2013-09-06 20:55:07 [INFO] <Bumtop> tells you how to craft everything
2013-09-06 20:55:22 [INFO] <Bumtop> we need to make you some armor
2013-09-06 20:55:47 [INFO] <Bumtop> this chest has iron, which we use for armor and a few other things
2013-09-06 20:55:58 [INFO] <Bumtop> i'll make you some armor to equip
2013-09-06 20:56:04 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> uau
2013-09-06 20:56:10 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> if you die you lose your armor?
2013-09-06 20:56:20 [INFO] <Bumtop> basically
2013-09-06 20:56:29 [INFO] <Bumtop> when you die, you "drop" everything you have with you
2013-09-06 20:56:59 [INFO] <Bumtop> luckily, you can probably pick them back up if you can get back to where you died
2013-09-06 20:57:13 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> wtf @ the spider outside
2013-09-06 20:57:30 [INFO] <Bumtop> yeah, spiders suck
2013-09-06 20:57:54 [INFO] <Bumtop> come pick up some armor in front of me
2013-09-06 20:58:23 [INFO] <Bumtop> there you go
2013-09-06 20:58:31 [INFO] <Bumtop> looking good
2013-09-06 20:58:33 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> we look a little KKK-ey
2013-09-06 20:58:39 [INFO] <Bumtop> yeah....
2013-09-06 20:58:52 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> so what's the next thing you were all working on
2013-09-06 20:59:05 [INFO] <Bumtop> well, mark had a project over by the door
2013-09-06 20:59:25 [INFO] <Bumtop> it's a prototype for a new front door
2013-09-06 20:59:33 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> haha
2013-09-06 20:59:47 [WARNING] Bumtop moved wrongly!
2013-09-06 20:59:49 [WARNING] Bumtop moved wrongly!
2013-09-06 20:59:57 [INFO] <Bumtop> doesn't hurt if you stop in the middle
2013-09-06 21:00:00 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> how much of that is a feature of the game?
2013-09-06 21:00:08 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> and how much is mark "programming" it??
2013-09-06 21:00:16 [INFO] <Bumtop> there's a material called "redstone"
2013-09-06 21:00:35 [INFO] <Bumtop> which is like copper wiring
2013-09-06 21:00:50 [INFO] <Bumtop> all of this is stuff built into minecraft
2013-09-06 21:00:56 [INFO] <Bumtop> no "programming"
2013-09-06 21:01:16 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> woah this game is not very alt-tab friendly
2013-09-06 21:01:18 [INFO] <Bumtop> you can create circuits with redstone, which can power pistons
2013-09-06 21:01:30 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> sounds complicated
2013-09-06 21:01:35 [INFO] <Bumtop> nah, if you alt-tab to something else, it pauses
2013-09-06 21:01:44 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> it loses full screen
2013-09-06 21:01:47 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> i'm on windows
2013-09-06 21:01:51 [INFO] <Bumtop> ????
2013-09-06 21:02:03 [INFO] <Bumtop> that's unfortunate
2013-09-06 21:02:30 [INFO] <Bumtop> but yeah, redstone is a little hard to learn all of the ins and outs of
2013-09-06 21:02:48 [INFO] <Bumtop> if you follow me to the back of the house, i can show you what i'm working on
2013-09-06 21:03:08 [INFO] <Bumtop> oh, that's lava, to incinerate useless stuff
2013-09-06 21:03:16 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> aha\
2013-09-06 21:03:20 [INFO] <Bumtop> this is a little fishing hut
2013-09-06 21:03:27 [INFO] <Bumtop> you can fish in this game :)
2013-09-06 21:03:38 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> why the hut? just for supplies
2013-09-06 21:03:42 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> or do you fish while inside it?
2013-09-06 21:03:51 [INFO] <Bumtop> no, just to store supplies
2013-09-06 21:04:20 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> discoverd sink holes
2013-09-06 21:04:36 [INFO] <Bumtop> those are probably the waterfalls in the garden area
2013-09-06 21:04:48 [INFO] <Bumtop> that's the old zombie farm over there
2013-09-06 21:04:57 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> can't jump over this fence?
2013-09-06 21:05:01 [INFO] <Bumtop> nope
2013-09-06 21:05:11 [INFO] <Bumtop> it's meant to keep animals in
2013-09-06 21:05:13 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> haha got it
2013-09-06 21:07:08 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> going wayyyyy up
2013-09-06 21:07:24 [INFO] <Bumtop> it goes all the way to the top of the world... literally
2013-09-06 21:07:37 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> feels like the exit in the Truman show
2013-09-06 21:07:58 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> jumped in some water
2013-09-06 21:07:59 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> oops

2013-09-06 21:09:34 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> so you guys did this stuff earlier it feels like
2013-09-06 21:09:38 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> less polished and focused
2013-09-06 21:09:46 [INFO] <Bumtop> yup

2013-09-06 21:10:01 [INFO] <Bumtop> we just started learning about automated farms
2013-09-06 21:10:10 [INFO] <Bumtop> well,
2013-09-06 21:10:29 [INFO] <Bumtop> up above the animals is an automated chicken farm that mark made
2013-09-06 21:10:45 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> automated how so
2013-09-06 21:10:48 [INFO] <Bumtop> behind you is a zombie farm that i made
2013-09-06 21:11:35 [INFO] <Bumtop> in this game, chickens lay eggs
2013-09-06 21:11:49 [INFO] <Bumtop> if you break an egg, there's a 1/20 chance it creates a baby chick
2013-09-06 21:12:01 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> lemme guess
2013-09-06 21:12:04 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> so you can get more eggs.
2013-09-06 21:12:20 [INFO] <Bumtop> or kill the chicken and cook it in a furnace :)
2013-09-06 21:12:27 [INFO] <Bumtop> cause we need food

2013-09-08 19:13:12 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> hi-o
2013-09-08 19:13:28 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> see my first tunnel?
2013-09-08 19:13:35 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> i did
2013-09-08 19:13:42 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> you've been busy
2013-09-08 19:13:58 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> i learned a few basics
2013-09-08 19:14:16 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> so i need ideas for shit to craft
2013-09-08 19:14:30 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> what do you wnat to build?
2013-09-08 19:14:53 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> i still don't have a good sense for what's possible
2013-09-08 19:16:04 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> or you can just keep mining
2013-09-08 19:16:14 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> sometimes i just like to mine and find lots of stuff
2013-09-08 19:16:24 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> and explire all the underground caves
2013-09-08 19:17:23 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> i think i'm most interested in learning to build interactive stuff
2013-09-08 19:17:35 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> like the door you're building or the chicken farm
2013-09-08 19:17:50 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> you could build an automated wheat farm
2013-09-08 19:18:04 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> or any farm like that
2013-09-08 19:18:20 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> i think the idea applies to pretty much anything (wheat, potatoes, carrots, etc)
2013-09-08 19:18:29 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> we also need an antoamted sorting & storage system
2013-09-08 19:18:39 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> how would that work
2013-09-08 19:19:01 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> you would dump all your stuff in a single chest, and it would sort it out and put it in the right ch
2013-09-08 19:19:06 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> chests*
2013-09-08 19:19:20 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> btw how the hell did a bad guy get into the great hall
2013-09-08 19:19:26 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> tall black thing
2013-09-08 19:19:39 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> and you would have like many chests for a single item (cobblestone) and you just grab some
2013-09-08 19:19:53 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> they jus spawn there sometimes
2013-09-08 19:20:00 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> that is an enderman (slenderman)
2013-09-08 19:20:51 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> well i accidentally broke a glass wall :(
2013-09-08 19:21:00 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> where is the glass
2013-09-08 19:21:06 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> right by the front door
2013-09-08 19:21:11 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> the walls use glass panes
2013-09-08 19:21:14 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> not glass block
2013-09-08 19:21:53 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> how do you make that. sand + heat?
2013-09-08 19:22:02 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> sand + heat = glass block
2013-09-08 19:22:10 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> then i think you turn glass block into glass panes
2013-09-08 19:22:25 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> repaired
2013-09-08 19:23:12 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> b/c of latency my keys keep sticking in chat
2013-09-08 19:26:35 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> watching a video on an autosorting system.
2013-09-08 19:26:40 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> jeez.

2013-09-08 19:26:55 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> but it will be awesome
2013-09-08 19:27:28 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> it seems like its awesomeness is limited by chest capacity
2013-09-08 19:28:21 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> you can link together lots of chests for long term storage
2013-09-08 19:28:32 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> linky to video?
2013-09-08 19:29:48 [INFO] <juiceFromGaf> looks like a 5-10 hour jobbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
