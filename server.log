2013-07-20 00:14:09 [INFO] <Bumtop> made 5 for now
2013-07-20 00:20:22 [INFO] <Bumtop> before you put dirt down, i need to find out if we need two layers of dirt below the other crops
2013-07-20 00:20:32 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> ok
2013-07-20 00:21:02 [INFO] <Bumtop> apparently sugar cane needs 2, but i don't know if thats needed for stuff like melons
2013-07-20 00:21:20 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> did we do 2 under those?
2013-07-20 00:21:46 [INFO] <Bumtop> most of it, there are a few patches that didn't but i dont have any more to plant right now
2013-07-20 00:22:42 [INFO] <Bumtop> might as well go a little deeper. there's iron over here.
2013-07-20 00:29:48 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> BAM
2013-07-20 00:30:07 [INFO] <Bumtop> when you gather sugar cane, don't cut it all the way down
2013-07-20 00:30:12 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> ok
2013-07-20 00:30:17 [INFO] <Bumtop> always leave a bit in the ground
2013-07-20 00:30:42 [INFO] <Bumtop> good call!
2013-07-20 00:32:20 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> what do you plant?
2013-07-20 00:32:29 [INFO] <Bumtop> sugar cane
2013-07-20 00:33:03 [INFO] <Bumtop> got more dirt?
2013-07-20 00:33:07 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> yup
2013-07-20 00:34:26 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> what do you need it for?
2013-07-20 00:34:32 [INFO] <Bumtop> sugar
2013-07-20 00:34:52 [INFO] <Bumtop> gonna be honest, we don't really need sugar for anything important
2013-07-20 00:34:59 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> lol
2013-07-20 00:35:03 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> what is it used for?
2013-07-20 00:35:07 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> paper i know
2013-07-20 00:35:12 [INFO] <Bumtop> to make paper and food
2013-07-20 00:36:04 [INFO] <Bumtop> its like chickens kinda
2013-07-20 00:36:28 [INFO] <Bumtop> in that this is probably overkill for what we really need
2013-07-20 00:36:33 [INFO] <Bumtop> but it is impressive
2013-07-20 00:36:46 [INFO] <Bumtop> especially for how fast it seems to be growing already
2013-07-20 00:39:04 [INFO] <Bumtop> ooooohhhh
2013-07-20 00:39:18 [INFO] <Bumtop> the patches it can't grow in are cause of the water requirements
2013-07-20 00:39:49 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> ah
2013-07-20 00:40:06 [INFO] <Bumtop> needs to share at least one side with a water block
2013-07-20 00:40:29 [INFO] <Bumtop> oh well, the outer rows will just have some patches for now
2013-07-20 00:43:24 [INFO] <Bumtop> think i'm going to convert the little sugar cane patch into a melon patch
2013-07-20 00:56:53 [INFO] <Bumtop> so much sugar!!!!
2013-07-20 00:58:48 [INFO] <Bumtop> haha i was just thinking about that
2013-07-20 01:04:38 [INFO] <Bumtop> can we make bricks?
2013-07-20 01:04:50 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> yes, with clay
2013-07-20 01:05:02 [INFO] <Bumtop> where in the world did you find clay?
2013-07-20 01:05:09 [INFO] <mvanholstyn> in the water
